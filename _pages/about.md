I am a cognitive psychology PhD student interested in **how we pay attention** and **what happens when our attention lapses**. We know from experience that our attentional state fluctuates continuously and that our attention impacts how we process and remember information. I use neuroimaging and behavioral methods to probe moment-to-moment changes in attentional state with the goal of answering the following questions: what underlies these fluctuations and what are the consequences for how we encode and remember information?

I am also an advocate for **transparent and open science** and believe science should be accessible to everyone. I lead the University of Chicago chapter of the [ReproducibiliTea Journal Club](https://reproducibilitea.org/), an initiative aimed at increasing scientific reproduciblity, transparency, and rigor. You can also find all of my research materials on the [Open Science Framework website](https://osf.io/profile/).
