1/1/23	Sustained neural representations of personally familiar people and places during cued recall	Cortex	The recall and visualization of familiar people and places is an everyday occurrence but the neural mechanisms underlying this ability are not yet well-characterized. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate pattern analysis we investigate the time course of familiar people and place representations in the brain. We show that distinct representations emerge ~1000 ms after cur onset and remain stable over an extended recall period (4s).	"Corriveau, A., Kidder, A., Teichmann, L., Wardle, S. G., & Baker, C. I.

4/15/23	Functional connectome stability and optimality are markers of cognitive performance	Cerebral Cortex	"Whole-brain patterns of fMRI functional connectivity are highly unique to individuals but change characteristically during tasks. Here, we tested whether individuals with more stable, typical, optimal, and distinctive patterns of functional connectivity perform better on cognitive tasks. We find that individuals with more stable (within-subject similarity across runs) and optimal (similarity to a task-optimal pattern) task-based functional connectivity show higher performance on sustained attention and working memory tasks.

9/16/24	Recognition memory fluctuates with sustained attention regardless of task relevance	Psychonomic Bulletin & Review	"Fluctuations in sustained attention influence task-related processing and memory. However, it is less clear how attentional state affects memory for irrelevant visual information. Here, we demonstrate that high attention leads to better memory, not only for task-relevant stimuli, but also task-irrelevant stimuli presented during high attentional states. Finally, we show that sustained attention and selective attention contribute separately to recognition memory, suggesting they compose separate constructs of attention.  "	"Corriveau, A., Chao, A.
