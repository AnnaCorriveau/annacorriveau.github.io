      "2023-01-01,Sustained neural representations of personally familiar people and places during cued recall,Cortex,The recall and visualization of familiar people and places is an everyday occurrence but the neural mechanisms underlying this ability are not yet well-characterized. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate pattern analysis we investigate the time course of familiar people and place representations in the brain. We show that distinct representations emerge ~1000 ms after cur onset and remain stable over an extended recall period (4s).,\"Corriveau, A., Kidder, A., Teichmann, L., Wardle, S. G., & Baker, C. I.

      "2023-04-15,Functional connectome stability and optimality are markers of cognitive performance,Cerebral Cortex,\"Whole-brain patterns of fMRI functional connectivity are highly unique to individuals but change characteristically during tasks. Here, we tested whether individuals with more stable, typical, optimal, and distinctive patterns of functional connectivity perform better on cognitive tasks. We find that individuals with more stable (within-subject similarity across runs) and optimal (similarity to a task-optimal pattern) task-based functional connectivity show higher performance on sustained attention and working memory tasks. \",\"Corriveau, A., Yoo, K., Kwon, Y.
