Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate pattern analysis we investigate the time course of familiar people and place representations in the brain. We show that distinct representations emerge ~1000 ms after cur onset and remain stable over an extended recall period (4s).,\"Corriveau, A., Kidder, A., Teichmann, L., Wardle, S. G., & Baker, C. I.

Here, we demonstrate that high attention leads to better memory, not only for task-relevant stimuli, but also task-irrelevant stimuli presented during high attentional states.

      "3/20/25,Functional brain networks predicting sustained attention are not specific to perceptual modality,Network Neuroscience,\"Sustained attention is essential for daily life and can be directed to information from different perceptual modalities, including audition and vision. Prior work has shown strong generalization of models trained to predict individual differences in sustained attention performance from patterns of fMRI functional connectivity. However, it is an open question whether predictions of sustained attention are specific to the perceptual modality in which they are trained. We find that functional networks are largely modality general, with both model-unique and shared model features predicting sustained attention performance in independent datasets regardless of task modality. Results support the supposition that visual and auditory sustained attention rely on shared neural mechanisms and demonstrate robust generalizability of whole-brain functional network models of sustained attention.\",\"Corriveau, A., Ke, J., Terashima, H., Kondo, H.

      "5/27/25,Sustained attentional state is a floodlight not a spotlight.,Journal of Experimental Psychology: General,\"Maintaining attention to a task is essential for accomplishing it. However, attentional state fluctuates from moment to moment, and task-irrelevant information may compete for processing. What are the consequences of attentional fluctuations for what we remember? Across individuals, we found no evidence of a trade-off between memory for task-relevant and task-irrelevant items. Within individuals, successful memory for a task-relevant item predicted successful memory for its task-irrelevant pair. Thus, the spotlight metaphor of attention does not extend to the dynamics of sustained attention. Rather, fluctuations in attention are more akin to a floodlight, affecting the processing of all task information, regardless of relevance.\",\"Corriveau, A., James, A. R., Jr., deBettencourt, M.
