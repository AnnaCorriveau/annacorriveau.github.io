excerpt: 'Whole-brain patterns of fMRI functional connectivity are highly unique to individuals but change characteristically during tasks. Here, we tested whether individuals with more stable, typical, optimal, and distinctive patterns of functional connectivity perform better on cognitive tasks. We find that individuals with more stable (within-subject similarity across runs) and optimal (similarity to a task-optimal pattern) task-based functional connectivity show higher performance on sustained attention and working memory tasks.

Whole-brain patterns of fMRI functional connectivity are highly unique to individuals but change characteristically during tasks. Here, we tested whether individuals with more stable, typical, optimal, and distinctive patterns of functional connectivity perform better on cognitive tasks. We find that individuals with more stable (within-subject similarity across runs) and optimal (similarity to a task-optimal pattern) task-based functional connectivity show higher performance on sustained attention and working memory tasks.
