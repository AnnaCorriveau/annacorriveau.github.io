excerpt: 'The recall and visualization of familiar people and places is an everyday occurrence but the neural mechanisms underlying this ability are not yet well-characterized. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate pattern analysis we investigate the time course of familiar people and place representations in the brain. We show that distinct representations emerge ~1000 ms after cur onset and remain stable over an extended recall period (4s).'

The recall and visualization of familiar people and places is an everyday occurrence but the neural mechanisms underlying this ability are not yet well-characterized. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate pattern analysis we investigate the time course of familiar people and place representations in the brain. We show that distinct representations emerge ~1000 ms after cur onset and remain stable over an extended recall period (4s).
