excerpt: 'Fluctuations in sustained attention influence task-related processing and memory. However, it is less clear how attentional state affects memory for irrelevant visual information. Here, we demonstrate that high attention leads to better memory, not only for task-relevant stimuli, but also task-irrelevant stimuli presented during high attentional states. Finally, we show that sustained attention and selective attention contribute separately to recognition memory, suggesting they compose separate constructs of attention.  '

Fluctuations in sustained attention influence task-related processing and memory. However, it is less clear how attentional state affects memory for irrelevant visual information. Here, we demonstrate that high attention leads to better memory, not only for task-relevant stimuli, but also task-irrelevant stimuli presented during high attentional states. Finally, we show that sustained attention and selective attention contribute separately to recognition memory, suggesting they compose separate constructs of attention.
