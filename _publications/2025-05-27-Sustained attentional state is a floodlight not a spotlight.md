title: "Sustained attentional state is a floodlight not a spotlight."

excerpt: 'Maintaining attention to a task is essential for accomplishing it. However, attentional state fluctuates from moment to moment, and task-irrelevant information may compete for processing. What are the consequences of attentional fluctuations for what we remember? Across individuals, we found no evidence of a trade-off between memory for task-relevant and task-irrelevant items. Within individuals, successful memory for a task-relevant item predicted successful memory for its task-irrelevant pair. Thus, the spotlight metaphor of attention does not extend to the dynamics of sustained attention. Rather, fluctuations in attention are more akin to a floodlight, affecting the processing of all task information, regardless of relevance.'

Maintaining attention to a task is essential for accomplishing it. However, attentional state fluctuates from moment to moment, and task-irrelevant information may compete for processing. What are the consequences of attentional fluctuations for what we remember? Across individuals, we found no evidence of a trade-off between memory for task-relevant and task-irrelevant items. Within individuals, successful memory for a task-relevant item predicted successful memory for its task-irrelevant pair. Thus, the spotlight metaphor of attention does not extend to the dynamics of sustained attention. Rather, fluctuations in attention are more akin to a floodlight, affecting the processing of all task information, regardless of relevance.
