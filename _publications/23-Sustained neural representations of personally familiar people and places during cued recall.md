collection: publications
permalink: /publication/1/1/23-Sustained neural representations of personally familiar people and places during cued recall
excerpt: 'The recall and visualization of familiar people and places is an everyday occurrence but the neural mechanisms underlying this ability are not yet well-characterized. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and multivariate pattern analysis we investigate the time course of familiar people and place representations in the brain. We show that distinct representations emerge ~1000 ms after cur onset and remain stable over an extended recall period (4s).'
